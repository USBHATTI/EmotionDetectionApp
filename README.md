🎭 EmotionDetection — Flask Emotion Detection App
A simple AI-powered web application that detects emotions from text input using machine learning and Flask.

🚀 Overview
This project was built as a real-time implementation after completing the "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" course by IBM on Coursera. The app takes user input text, processes it through an emotion classification model, and returns the detected emotion in real-time via a Flask web interface.

🧠 Features
Detects emotions from user-inputted text

Real-time results using Flask backend

Clean, modular code following PEP8 standards
